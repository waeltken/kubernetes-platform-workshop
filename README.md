# Kubernetes Multi-Tenant Platform with GitOps Workshop

This workshop will guide you through the process of setting up a Kubernetes
multi-tenant platform using GitOps on Azure.

We make use of infrastructure as code to provision the required Azure resources
and use GitOps to deploy and manage the Kubernetes platform. This approach will
allow us to easily scale the platform and keep it up to date, manage multiple
environments and provide self-service capabilities to our developers.
